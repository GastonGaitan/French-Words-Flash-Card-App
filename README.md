# French-Words-Flash-Card-App
Idea taken from 100 days of code from Angela Yu.
Only taken the Idea and then coded and solved everything on my own.

Instructions:
- Every French word will be shown during 5 seconds.
- After 5 seconds, the English translation will be shown.
- If you knew the translation before it was shown, click on the green button. This burron will delete the word from the data and save it so that it will not be shown again.
- Otherwise, If you didn't know the answer click the red button to see the next word.

Extra features added:
- A timer will be shown on the screen while the user waits for the next instruction.
- Both green and red buttons will be disables during the count down.
